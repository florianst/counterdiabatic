# Counterdiabatic driving

This contains tools to simulate the efficient translation of laser-trapped atom clouds by the use of counterdiabatic driving potentials. An excellent introduction into these can be found in Sels and Polkovnikov, PNAS 114, 3909 (2017).

The protocol implemented here is described in D. Sels, Physical Review A 97, 040302 (2018). One of the simulations presented here is using the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) of wavefunction time development presented there.

Results and further documentation can be found in twa_documentation.pdf.
